# Roxen Application Launcher for Linux

For those fortunate enough working with [Roxen](http://roxen.com/) CMS, 
Roxen Application Launcher lets you edit files on a remote Roxen CMS server 
in your preferred desktop application.

This Roxen Application Launcher is primarily for the GNOME desktop, but it 
builds fine in KDE as well, and is written in the programming language Vala 
which isn't needed per se if this is the distribution package which will build 
from the C sources that was generated by the Vala compiler.

## Getting started

Distribution friendly sources (doesn't require Vala to build) can be found under
[Releases](https://github.com/poppa/Roxen-Application-Launcher/releases)

**To build run:**

    name@machine:~$ ./configure
    name@machine:~$ make
    name@machine:~$ make install


## Requirements

| Name       | Version | Library          |
| ---------- | ------: | ---------------- |
| GLib       | 2.42.2  | libglib          |
| GTK        | 3.12.2  | libgtk3.0        |
| SOUP       | 2.46.0  | libsoup2.4       |

This is what's in Ubuntu 14.10.
