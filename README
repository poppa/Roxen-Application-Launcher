Roxen Application Launcher for Linux
================================================================================

For those fortunate enough working with Roxen CMS, Roxen Application Launcher
lets you edit files on a remote Roxen CMS server in your preferred desktop
application.

This Roxen Application Launcher is primarily for the GNOME desktop, but it 
builds fine in KDE as well, and is written in the programming language Vala 
which isn't needed per se if this is the distribution package which will build 
from the C sources that was generated by the Vala compiler.


Getting started
================================================================================

To build run:

  name@machine:~$ ./configure
  name@machine:~$ make
  name@machine:~$ make install


Requirements
================================================================================

  GLib        2.30.0    libglib
  GTK         3.2.0     libgtk2.0
  SOUP        2.36.0    libsoup2.4
  GIO         2.3.0     glib-networking
  GDK Pixbuf  2.24.0    libgdk-pixbuf2.0
  Notify      0.7.4     libnotify

This is what's in Ubuntu 11.10.


Build from Vala sources
================================================================================

If you build from the Vala sources Vala 0.16 is required.
